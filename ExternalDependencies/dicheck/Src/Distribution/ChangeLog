     * dicheck.cc: When executed as 'trimtrailing' 
       it silently copies 'file' to 'file.out' while trimming off
       trailing whitespace.

     * dicheck.cc: When there was an indent error on a line
       the trailing whitespace report was bogus.
       Fixed indent mistakes in dicheck.
       Exits with code zero if no errors noted.
     * testcase: Added a blank trailing character on a line
       with a bad indent.
     * Makefile: Now runs dicheck on its source too for 'make test'.
